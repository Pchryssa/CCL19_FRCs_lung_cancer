# CCL19<sup>+</sup> fibroblastic reticular cell niches in lung cancer


This repository contains scripts to reproduce the computational analysis from the paper ["Fibroblastic reticular cells generate protective intratumoral T cell environments in lung cancer"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.10.042), published at Cell on 19 November 2024

This repository also contains scripts to reproduce the computational analysis from the paper ["Protocol to investigate fibroblastic reticular cell-immune cell interaction in human lung cancer"]
